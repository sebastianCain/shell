FRB-SC SHELL
by Felix Rieg-Baumhauer and Sebastian Cain

Features:
	Executes simple commands, ie (ls or ls -l), done by forking, 
	Executes commands even if there is unforseen whitespace, ie (ls    -l)
	Executes cd and exit, done without forking
	Execues multiple commands on one line, separted by ";",  ie (ls ; ls -l)
	Executes simple redirection, one set of redirects only
		-stdin <
		-stout >
		-stdout append >>
	Executes simple pipes, ie (ls | wc), one set of pipes only
	Has a "descriptive" prompt that describes to the user in which approximate directory they are
	
	
Attempted:
	Complex redirection
	Compex pipes-the surrent pipe structure that we use is not well suited to being used recursivelly
